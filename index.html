		<h1>PortaPlanter™</h1>
		<p class="left">PortaPlanter™ makes products that help you have healthier, more manageable,
			and more environmentally beneficial plants and planters.
			Our products enable you to use less water, energy, and effort than any of the alternatives,
			and they can decorate an office, house, or yard.</p>

		<img class="img-responsive" src="http://portaplanter.com/image/PortaPlanter_Stream_IMG_3658_wXX.jpg" alt="Production-2" >

		<h2>Products</h2>
		<p class="left">Our systems span from cozy and decorative 20 gallon models to full-sized (but still portable and beautiful) 240
			gallon systems.
			See below for some of our models, and please <a href="#contact">contact us</a> if you want to find out more
		</p>


		<h3>PortaPlanter™ 10 and 20 Gallon Containers </h3>

		<p class="left">
			Our 10 and 20 Gallon containers are just 12 inches deep and at most 24 inches wide.
			They are perfect for accenting indoor spaces.
			Each can be planted in directly or divided by two to four removable planters.
		</p>

		<h4>10 Gallon Green Edge, Clear, and White Starter Set, with Planters </h4>

		<h3>PortaPlanter™ 40 and 50 Gallon Containers </h3>

		<p class="left">
			Our 40 and 50 gallon containers are "panoramic" with a base 12 inches by 30 inches.
			They are great for decorating larger indoor spaces, can have a custom front panel design,
			and can be divided by three or four removable planters.
		</p>


		<h4>50 Gallon Green Edge, Clear, and White Starter Set, with Planters</h4>
		<img class="img-responsive" src="http://portaplanter.com/image/PortaPlanter_50_w1800.jpg" alt="Brochure" width="900">


		<h3>PortaPlanter™ 80 through 240 Gallon Containers </h3>


		<p class="left">
			Our 80, 120, and 240 gallon containers are designed for outside decoration, garden, greenhouse, and commercial
			spaces.  They range from two feet by three feet to a full four feet by four feet size, and all
			have a large front panel that can be artisticly designed.  Planter sets
			divide the large space into approximately one foot 'cubes' for easy management of the plants.
			All containers 80 gallon and larger come with an optional pallet for support and movement,
			even when the lower water section (about 20 gallons for the 80 gallon container) is full.
		</p>
		<p class="left">These larger containers can transform dead spaces like driveways, walkways, and roofs into green beltways.
		</p>

			Below are some pictures.</p>

		<h3>
			Palo Alto Residence
		</h3>
		<p class="left">This 120 Gallon PortaPlanter™ is planted by 'V' in her semi-urban farm on what would otherwise be a dead zone (a
			driveway). For fun it has a mirror-box that
			reflects on the front, and the owner built out her own trellis system for it. It is planted with herbs (Oregano, Basil, Thyme, etc.), sweet peas, and Kale.
		</p>

		<h3>
			Palo Alto Elementary School
		</h3>
		<p class="left">This 120 Gallon PortaPlanter™ sits in a dead zone of an Elementary School right next to the Kindergarten and First
			grade classrooms, so the kids
			can see the watering system run every couple hours (a minute at a time), and pick the peppers themselves to
			understand
			how plants grow and fruit. Besides peppers, it also contains many different types of herbs and some decorative
			flowers and ferns.
			There is no power nearby, so it runs with a Yeti 150 from GoalZero.
		</p>

		<h3>
			Palo Alto Residence
		</h3>
		<p class="left">Pictured below is PortaPlanter™ 'Prototype-2', the second 120 gallon prototype which is planted directly in the
			container vs. having planters. At the time of the picture it was
			growing lettuces and peppers. Currently it is growing kale and carrots along with the peppers.

		<h2>Company</h2>
		<p class="left">PortaPlanter™ was founded by <a href="http://linkedin.com/in/markfussell" target="_blank">Mark</a> when he tried to
			tried to transform his wife's and daughter's
			backyard garden into a mobile and efficient mini-farm. By studying nature and farms, and after working through
			months of failures,
			Mark and his team invented the patent-pending FireHorse basin system. This enabled unprecedented productivity and
			efficiency: the systems use almost no energy (pennies a day)
			and they have almost no water loss. The basins can be "topped off" every week or even longer depending on the tank
			size.
			And the systems run perfectly on a small, portable or permanent, solar system like those from
			<a href="http://goalzero.com" target="_blank">Goal Zero</a>.
