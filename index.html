<p>PortaPlanter™ makes products that help you have healthier, more portable, 
and more environmentally beneficial plants and planters.
Our products use less water, energy, and effort than any of the alternatives, 
and they can decorate an office, house, or yard.</p>

<p>Our basic 20 gallon model is described below but we make systems in all sizes, with larger systems being acrylic or aluminum.  
Our largest planter so far is about 200 gallons and can be placed on flat roofs to make them green either seasonally or year-round 
(depending on your climate).

These are a pair of decorative basins that also enable easily moving 
plants into and out of the PortaPlanter™.  With four or more basins,
you could rotate your plants for fun, decoration, or to water more plants.
