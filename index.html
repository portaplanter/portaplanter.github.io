<h3>PortaPlanter™ 40 and 50 Gallon Containers </h3>

<h3>PortaPlanter™ 80 through 240 Gallon Containers </h3>


<p>
    Our 80, 120, and 240 gallon containers are designed for outside decoration, garden, greenhouse, and commercial
    spaces.  They range from two feet by three feet to a full four feet by four feet size, and all

    divide the large space into approximately one foot 'cubes' for easy management of the plants.
    All containers 80 gallon and larger come with an optional pallet for support and movement,
    even when the lower water section (about 20 gallons for the 80 gallon container) is full.
</p>
<p>These larger containers can transform dead spaces like driveways, walkways, and roofs into green beltways.

<h2>Products in Use</h2>

    <p>PortaPlanter™ products are being used in the San Francisco Bay Area from Palo Alto up through Daly City.
    Below are some pictures.</p>

<h3>
Palo Alto Residence
</h3>
<p>This 120 Gallon PortaPlanter™ is planted by 'V' in her semi-urban farm on what would otherwise be a dead zone (a
    driveway). For fun it has a mirror-box that
    reflects on the front, and the owner built out her own trellis system for it. It is planted with herbs (Oregano, Basil, Thyme, etc.), sweet peas, and Kale.
</p>

<h3>
Palo Alto Elementary School
</h3>
<p>This 120 Gallon PortaPlanter™ sits in a dead zone of an Elementary School right next to the Kindergarten and First
    grade classrooms, so the kids
    can see the watering system run every couple hours (a minute at a time), and pick the peppers themselves to
    understand
    how plants grow and fruit. Besides peppers, it also contains many different types of herbs and some decorative
    flowers and ferns.
    There is no power nearby, so it runs with a Yeti 150 from GoalZero.

    <h3>
Palo Alto Residence
</h3>
<p>Pictured below is PortaPlanter™ 'Prototype-2', the second 120 gallon prototype which is planted directly in the
    container vs. having planters. At the time of the picture it was
    growing lettuces and peppers. Currently it is growing kale and carrots along with the peppers.

<h2>Company</h2>
<p>PortaPlanter™ was founded by <a href="http://linkedin.com/in/markfussell" target="_blank">Mark</a> when he tried to
    tried to transform his wife's and daughter's
    backyard garden into a mobile and efficient mini-farm. By studying nature and farms, and after working through
    months of failures,
    Mark and his team invented the patent-pending FireHorse basin system. This enabled unprecedented productivity and
    efficiency: the systems use almost no energy (pennies a day)
    and they have almost no water loss. The basins can be "topped off" every week or even longer depending on the tank
    size.
    And the systems run perfectly on a small, portable or permanent, solar system like those from
    <a href="http://goalzero.com" target="_blank">Goal Zero</a>.
