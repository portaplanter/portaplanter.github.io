<p>PortaPlanter™ makes products that help you have healthier, more portable, 
and more environmentally beneficial plants and planters.
Our products use less water, energy, and effort than any of the alternatives, 
and they can decorate an office, house, or yard.</p>

<p>Our basic 20 gallon model is described below but we make systems in all sizes, with larger systems being acrylic or aluminum.  
Our largest planter so far is about 200 gallons and can be placed on flat roofs to make them green either seasonally or year-round 
(depending on your climate).

<h2>Company</h2>
<p>PortaPlanter™ was founded by <a href="http://linkedin.com/in/markfussell">Mark</a> when he tried to tried to transform his wife and daughter's 
backyard garden into a mobile and efficient mini-farm.  By studying nature and farms, and after working through months of failures,
Mark invented the patent-pending FireHorse basin system.  This enabled unprecedented productivity and efficiency: the systems use almost no energy (less than a KwH a day)
and have almost no water loss.  The basins can be "topped off" every week or even longer depending on the tank size.
And the systems run perfectly on a small, portable or permanent,  solar system like those from <a href="http://goalzero.com">Goal Zero</a>.
