<h2>Company</h2>
<p>PortaPlanter™ was founded by <a href="http://linkedin.com/in/markfussell">Mark</a> when he tried to tried to transform his wife's and daughter's 
backyard garden into a mobile and efficient mini-farm.  By studying nature and farms, and after working through months of failures,
Mark and his team invented the patent-pending FireHorse basin system.  This enabled unprecedented productivity and efficiency: the systems use almost no energy (pennies a day)
and have almost no water loss.  The basins can be "topped off" every week or even longer depending on the tank size.
And the systems run perfectly on a small, portable or permanent,  solar system like those from <a href="http://goalzero.com">Goal Zero</a>.
