<h3>Products in Use</h3>
  <h4>
      Prototype-2 : Palo Alto
  </h4>
<p>Pictured below is 'Prototype-2', the second 120 gallon prototype which is planted directly in the container vs. having planters.  At the time of the picture it was
    growing lettuces and peppers.  Currently it is growing kale and carrots along with the peppers.

  <h4>
      Production-1 : Palo Alto Residence
  </h4>
  <p>This one is planted by 'V' in her semi-urban farm on what would otherwise be a dead zone (a driveway).  For fun it has a mirror-box that
      reflects on the front.  It is planted with herbs (Oregano, Basil, Thyme, etc.) and Kale.

  <h2>Company</h2>
<p>PortaPlanter™ was founded by <a href="http://linkedin.com/in/markfussell" target="_blank">Mark</a> when he tried to tried to transform his wife's and daughter's
backyard garden into a mobile and efficient mini-farm.  By studying nature and farms, and after working through months of failures,
Mark and his team invented the patent-pending FireHorse basin system.  This enabled unprecedented productivity and efficiency: the systems use almost no energy (pennies a day)
and have almost no water loss.  The basins can be "topped off" every week or even longer depending on the tank size.
And the systems run perfectly on a small, portable or permanent,  solar system like those from <a href="http://goalzero.com" target="_blank">Goal Zero</a>.
